# Garden layout

Plants need either 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day, partial sun, or are fine growing in shade. The sun travels from east to west every day. In the northern hemisphere, that means that pointing your garden to the _south_ will allow plants the most amount of sunlight possible withouth being blocked by a house, trees, or other taller structures that will block the sun to the garden.
